            <strong><i> Cha Caf&eacute; </i></strong> serves coffee and tea. They also serve food such as baked goods
            and desserts. It is a nice place to socialize with friends and maybe get work done. <br /> 
            I like it because it is near Micro Beach and American Memorial Park.
